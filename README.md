## Read through the assignment and generate your estimate for your estimation assignment


## PIMPL

Using the repo https://github.com/olekaspt/SoftwareArchitectureCLassApplication.git

Your goal is to generate an new class in the C++ Automation binding, which uses the PIMPL pattern.

PDF Report:

## Document an API

Pick your favorite language from the following list. - Python, Java, C++, or C#

Generate a stub API to do following (image it works like excel)

1) API to obtain an Session object
3) API to represent an Workbook object
2) API to manipulate the Workbooks (open, close, save) off of Session
3) API to represent an Worksheet object
4) API to manipulate an Work sheet object (make active, delete, rename)

An Session can have mutliple work books, and each workbook contains 1 or more worksheets.

Document the API using the rules put forth in the slide deck.  

Generate the API reference using doxygen or javadoc (doxygen can handle C#, Python, and C++).  If you use Python use PEP 484 as a guide on how to docuemnt the signatures.
